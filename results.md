# Industrial Safety Q&A â€” Results

## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a mini RAG-based Q&A system over 20 public PDFs on industrial and machine safety. The system uses:

- **Baseline search:** cosine similarity over embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) stored in FAISS.
- **Hybrid reranker:** blends vector similarity with keyword relevance (BM25/SQLite FTS).
- **Abstain logic:** avoids answering when top evidence score is below threshold (0.25).

## 2. Evaluation Questions

1. What is PPE in industrial safety?
2. Explain the purpose of a fire extinguisher.
3. What is a lockout-tagout procedure?
4. Define occupational hazard.
5. What should be done during a chemical spill?
6. What is the safe limit for noise exposure?
7. Explain the use of safety harness.
8. Why are MSDS sheets important?

5. Learnings

Hybrid reranker significantly improves answer quality by combining semantic similarity with keyword relevance.

Abstain logic ensures that low-confidence answers are not returned, improving reliability.

CPU-based embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) are lightweight and sufficient for small document sets.
